# Housing Analysis Notebook

## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook contains an analysis of housing data, exploring various aspects such as descriptive statistics, data visualization, and linear regression models. The analysis is performed using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Data Exploration

The initial section focuses on exploring the dataset. It includes loading the data, displaying summary statistics, and visualizing the distribution of numerical and categorical features.

## Simple Linear Regression

The next part of the notebook introduces simple linear regression. It demonstrates how to create a linear regression model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

## Multiple Linear Regression

Building upon simple linear regression, this section extends the analysis to multiple linear regression. It includes the selection of relevant features, model creation, evaluation, and visualization of predicted vs. actual values.

## Conclusion

The conclusion summarizes key findings, discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and provides insights and recommendations for potential improvements.

## Repository Structure

- `Housing.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook file.
- `Housing.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md`: A readme file providing an overview of the analysis and instructions for running the notebook.

Feel free to explore and run the notebook to gain insights into the housing dataset.
